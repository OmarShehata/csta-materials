# PlayHack: Teaching Code by Hacking on Open-Source Games 
Welcome! This README contains all the resources & links mentioned in a [CSTA 2017 conference talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17RI6qzzzmmxMXgPVCKjlC8jQIwxaTt-SJ1_N2bQtkv4/edit?usp=sharing) by [Omar Shehata](https://github.com/OmarShehata) & [Eileen King](https://github.com/comeoneileen).

## Links & Resources

These are all either tools to use in the classroom or resources you can use in creating teaching materials. 

* [The Big List of Open Source Games](https://github.com/leereilly/games) - hundreds of open source games across all genres and platforms, great source of material.
* [Hacking Super Mario](https://medium.com/@omar4ur/hacking-super-mario-a-coderdojo-tutorial-6bbb2ae05f0c#.80969u14u) - the tutorial we wrote for guiding students through hacking on an HTML5 Super Mario clone.
* [Hacking Flappy Bird in Scratch](https://medium.com/@eileenaking/hacking-scratch-games-a-coderdojo-tutorial-48c2a6ec3236) - another tutorial we wrote for guiding students through remixing and modifying Flappy Bird in Scratch.
* [Pixlr](http://pixlr.com/editor/) - neat tool for in-browser image editing, used by our students to customize sprites in their hacked Mario games
* [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com) - 3D WebGL game engine for making games in the browser, great for collaborating and finding projects to fork (all in the browser).
* [Lunar Lander PlayCanvas](https://medium.com/@omar4ur/rescue-the-lunar-lander-a-coderdojo-tutorial-5217d463e26a#.l7vuweb49) - tutorial we wrote on how to fork and make a spaceship fly in PlayCanvas.
* [Mozilla Thimble](http://thimble.mozilla.org/) - great tool for creating web apps in the browser, as well as remixing projects and inline tutorials.
* [Glitch](https://glitch.com/ ) - awesome tool for making web apps in the browser, complete with a backend, database and everything! Also a great place to collaborate in real time as well as remix projects. [Here](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/tutsplus-pirate-shooter) is a sample project Omar made for a multiplayer games workshop.

## Takeaways 

If you're anything like us and you're terrible at taking notes, we've compiled some of our important takeaways for you here! 

### 1. Young students are capable of working with complex open source software

Our biggest fear was that throwing students who were just starting to learn to program into these big complicated projects would scare them away. We were surprised to find that they rose to the challenge and found it very engaging. It worked out because, if organized well, an open source piece of software provides multiple tiers of entry - it's an activity that scaffolds itself. On one extreme, you can easily change numbers in the code without any programming knowledge and immediately see changes. On the other, you can try to dig into the codebase and extend or add functionality. 

### 2. It's really fun, and empowering! 

It's very easy to motivate students when they get to work on a popular game they actually recognize or enjoy playing. Showing them that they can take something like that, open it up, see how it works and make changes to it is also an incredibly powerful feeling. It's proof that the world around them is created by people and it lifts the curtains on what that looks like. 

### 3. Natural motivator for digging into the "boring stuff"

Getting students to sit down and read someone else's code (or even to debug their own) is otherwise a laborious task. Hacking gives them a natural reason to do careful reading, so choose your material carefully to serve as a "mentor text!" When students are presented with well written, readable code to hack, they see firsthand that naming your variables and functions well isn't just something you do to make your teacher happy. Similarly, hacking a project that includes use of unfamiliar language features is a natural opening to learn how to read documentation.

### 4. Start with a broken build

One common problem we've faced is that students will get distracted by _playing_ the game before they get to digging into the code. One easy way to fix that is to start with a version that has a minor error or bug that prevents them from playing, and the first task being to fix that before they test out the game. 

### 5. Provide guided early wins 

This is especially important for beginners. A large codebase can be intimidating if you don't know where to start. Point them to lines of code where their changes will have visible consequences. Better yet, provide an example of how to _find_ something in the code (sometimes, just guessing that the jump code will have the word "jump" somewhere in it and CTRL+F in the file is a good start).

### 6. It's ideal for group work/sharing knowledge

Learning how to fork other people's projects is a great excuse to practice working off each other's code. A lot of the tools we mentioned above also support multiple people working together in the same project in real time. Even students who worked independently were excited to explain their discoveries, learn from one another, and share knowledge - so much good communication.
