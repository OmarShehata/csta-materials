# PlayHack: Teaching Code by Hacking on Open-Source Games 
Welcome! This README contains all the resources & links we mentioned in our CSTA 2017 conference talk by [Omar Shehata](https://github.com/OmarShehata) & [Eileen King](https://github.com/comeoneileen).

## Links & Resources

These are all either tools to use in the classroom or resources you can use in creating teaching materials. 

* [The Big List of Open Source Games](https://github.com/leereilly/games) - hundreds of open source games across all genres and platforms, great source of material.
* [Hacking Super Mario](https://medium.com/@omar4ur/hacking-super-mario-a-coderdojo-tutorial-6bbb2ae05f0c#.80969u14u) - the tutorial we used for guiding students through hacking on an HTML5 Super Mario clone.
* [Hacking Flappy Bird in Scratch](https://medium.com/@eileenaking/hacking-scratch-games-a-coderdojo-tutorial-48c2a6ec3236) - another tutorial we used for guiding students through remixing and modifying Flappy Bird in Scratch.
* [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com) - 3D WebGL game engine for making games in the browser, great for collaborating and finding projects to fork (all in the browser).
* [Lunar Lander PlayCanvas](https://medium.com/@omar4ur/rescue-the-lunar-lander-a-coderdojo-tutorial-5217d463e26a#.l7vuweb49) - tutorial on how to fork and make a spaceship fly in PlayCanvas.
* [Mozilla Thimble](http://thimble.mozilla.org/) - great tool for creating web apps in the browser, as well as remixing projects and inline tutorials.
* [Glitch](https://glitch.com/ ) - awesome tool for making web apps in the browser, complete with a backend, database and everything! Also a great place to collaborate in real time as well as remix projects.

## Takeaways 

If you're anything like me and you're terrible at taking notes, we've compiled some of our important takeaways for you here! 

### 1. Young students are capable of working with complex open source software

Our biggest fear was that throwing students who were just starting to learn to program into these big complicated projects would scare them away. We were surprised to find that they rose up to the challenge and found it very engaging. It worked out because, if organized well, an open source piece of software provides multiple tiers of entry. On one extreme, you can easily change numbers in the code without any programming knowledge and immediately see changes. On the other, you can try to dig into the codebase and extend or add functionality. 

### 2. It's really fun, and empowering! 

### 3. It provides a standard to aspire to 

### 4. Start with a broken build

### 5. Provide guided early wins 

### 6. It's ideal for group work
